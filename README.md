# Angular 2 Designer

Angular 2 Designer is a cloud based server which allows the user to quickly and easily create an angular application in real time. It provides the user with the following functions: 

  - A web based designer which will enable the user to add, remove and modify pages through the use of our easy to use interface
  - See the changes made to the app in real time
  - Download the source code if the user wishes to continue development on his/her own
